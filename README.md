# Football Score
Instead of watching the 2020 Super Bowl game, I made a Python program to calculate the possible scores that a team could get.

So far this only does field goals and touchdowns without that extra point thing.

## Dependencies
The main one is NumPy, but if I add any more, I will add it to the requirements.yml file. I'm using Conda to handle dependencies.
